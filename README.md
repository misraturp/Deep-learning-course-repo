# Deep Learning 101 course repository

Welcome! Here you can find all the code we develop in the course.
You can use this repo to follow along during the coding exercises and to complete your assignments later.

The code is organized in modules.

Don't forget to ask any of your questions if you get stuck anywhere. You can reach me at misra@soyouwanttobeadatascientist.com
